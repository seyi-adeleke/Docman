# FAQ


## How do I access the API?
A link to the `api` is provided **[here](https://docman-cp2-staging.herokuapp.com/api/v1)** 
All Api endpoints are restful

## What format is the reponse?

The API currently returns data in `JSON` format.

## Authentication?
All api endpoints require authentication and authorization. On succesfull login or signup a token is returned. Set the token as the value to the `Authorization` key in your `headers`.

# Limitations
The api uses a shared database connection thereby leading to occasionally slow response times

# Environments
This project has three environments configured all with their own databases
 - Development
 - Test
 - Production
 
### Development
This describes my local devlopment environment with certain configurations that make the workflow easier. It's designed to simulate a production environment as closely as possible but it is configured to work with dummy data
### Test
The test environment is used to run the integration and unit tests for this application, it is completely seperate and it has its own migrations and seeders. For this project the test environment is configured on TRAVIS CI.
### Production
This is the live environment that contains real data. Currently, it is hosted on Heroku.
